# Graphics with loops
This small project involves a class that creates and manipulates graphics elements stored in an ArrayList.

Intereactive buttons for the shapes; Pie, Stripes, Snowflake. As well as a button to change the colors of each shape.

When pressed run the class will open a text window to ask for an input of the number of divisions each shape will have for instance, the pie will have more slices, the stripes will have more stripes, and the snowflake will have more jagged edges to represent division as a koch snowflake.

"Invalid input, value not in range" will be prompted when the number does not exisit (too low) or too high. These static values are already initiated at the start of the file and can be changed however the user wants.
